go-yaml-node
============

Load a YAML file and print the nodes


## Description

This program is extremely useful for understanding / debugging how
[go-yaml](https://github.com/yaml/go-yaml) loads YAML documents.

The `Unmarshal` function loads YAML documents into a `Node` data type.

This program will read YAML from stdin and print the nodes in an indented tree
format, showing all the (non-empty) field values.


## Usage

Example:

```
$ go-yaml-node <<< 'scalar forms: [null, true, yes, 0xcafe, 0o123, 12:34:56]'
